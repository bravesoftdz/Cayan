Delphi Library for Payment Integration using Cayan Solutions

NOTE: This library was written by Jerry Dodge, and not by any direct member of Cayan. No guarantees are made towards this code, and is available on an as-is basis. Neither I or Cayan are responsible for any problems which arise as a result of using this code.

NOTE: While this library is free and open-source, you are still responsible to acquire certification with Cayan to be allowed to work with their solutions. This library only wraps Cayan's APIs, and you must treat the integration the same as if you wrote it.

NOTE: This library uses its own copy of X-SuperObject. Since there were modifications in those units to be able to work as needed, it was necessary to include them in this repo. However, it must be noted that the units `Cayan.XSuperObject` and `Cayan.XSuperJSON` were not actually written with the rest of this library.

## Delphi Support

This library was written for Delphi 10 Seattle. While it should work in most modern Delphi versions, it has not been tested, and there is no guarantee that it will be compatible.
